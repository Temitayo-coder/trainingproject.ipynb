# **Predicting Customer Churn in Retail: Insights from Customer Behavior and Financial Data**  

## **Overview**  
This project aims to predict customer churn in the retail sector using **machine learning techniques**, leveraging **customer behavior and financial data**. The study explores key factors influencing customer retention and applies various **supervised and unsupervised learning models** to develop an accurate churn prediction framework.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains **customer demographic details, transaction history, spending patterns, and engagement metrics**. Key features include:  
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, location  
- **Purchase Behavior**: Frequency of transactions, spending habits  
- **Financial Indicators**: Credit score, payment history  
- **Engagement Metrics**: Loyalty program participation, response to marketing campaigns  

## **Machine Learning Models Used**  
The following models were implemented and compared:  
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - XGBoost  
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
  - Stacking Classifier (Logistic Regression + Gradient Boosting + Random Forest)  

- **Unsupervised Learning**:  
  - K-Means Clustering (for customer segmentation)  

## **Key Features of the Analysis**  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and relationships  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Identifying the most important factors driving churn  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models for better accuracy  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC Curve  
✅ **Customer Segmentation**: Using clustering to identify different customer personas  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using **Streamlit** to visualize churn predictions  

## **Results & Insights**  
- Customers with **low engagement** and **irregular spending patterns** are more likely to churn.  
- Higher **credit score** and **consistent spending behavior** reduce churn risk.  
- Implementing **personalized marketing strategies** can significantly improve retention rates.
